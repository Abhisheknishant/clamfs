    <!-- Clamd socket settings
         socket - location of clamd socket (may vary between operating systems)
                  For Debian GNU/Linux it is /var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl, on
                  FreeBSD use /var/run/clamav/clamd.sock.
         mode   - there three different mode available to pass file to clamd
            mode="fname" - pass file name (with SCAN command)
            mode="fdpass" - pass file descriptor (with FILDES command)
            mode="stream" - pass file stream (with INSTREAM command)
         check  - (yes or no) check if clamd is available on startup (useful if
                  mounting clamfs file systems from /etc/fstab early on startup,
                  while clamav daemon is not yet started) -->
