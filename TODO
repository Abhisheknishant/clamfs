 TO DO
 =====

* file extension whitelist and blacklist (whitelisted files
  are never scanned and blacklisted are scanned even they are
  bigger than file limit)
* negative cache (cache information about infected files)
* file system statistics (files accessed, files scanned,
  excluded files, cache hit/miss, viruses detected, etc.)
* better configuration file handling (preferably using POCO)
* ability to set all parameters from command line?
* mount helper?
