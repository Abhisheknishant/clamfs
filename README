ClamFS is a FUSE-based user-space file system for Linux with on-access
anti-virus file scanning through clamd daemon (a file scanning service
developed by ClamAV Project).

To build ClamFS you need:
 * FUSE
 * GNU libCommonCpp (and libxml2 as it's dependency)
 * RLog
 * POCO[1]

As a run-time dependency you need:
 * ClamAV (clamd)

[1] - POCO version 1.2.8 contain 4-BSDL licensed files and thus you
      should avoid linking it against any GPL licensed code. I strongly
      advise using version 1.2.9 (as license issues has been fixed).
